##Reports

Once the test suit has finished executing the following reports are generated under the target folder

* Cucumber Report on this directory target/cucumber-html-reports and open -> (overview-features.html)
* Extent Report on this directory target/test-output/HtmlReport and open -> (ExtentHtml.html)

## High-level Framework Overview

The framework uses Cucumber to describe high-level functional tests. 

* Page Actions are used to perform user actions and validate expected results.
* Page Objects are used to store all element objects for each screen.

## Gherking and BDD
The Golden Gherkin Rule: Treat other readers as you would want to be treated. Write Gherkin so that people who donâ€™t know the feature will understand it.

The Cardinal Rule of BDD: One Scenario, One Behavior!

Write all steps in third-person point of view. If first-person and third-person steps mix, scenarios become confusing.

* Givens should always use present or present perfect tense

* Whens and Thens should always use present tense.
